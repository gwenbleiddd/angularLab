    "review_text": "I had a pleasure of staying in this hotel for 7 nights recently. This hotel was perfect in every way. Communication with the hotel before staying was prompt, and very efficient. Checking in was a breeze. You go through the spectacular lobby with modern glass chandeliers and take the elevator to your room. My room, they gave me an upgrade to junior suite, was spectacular. We had a walk-in closet of the size where you could have put a small bed in there; it served us nicely for the seven day stay. The decor was very refined, and oh the bathroom! Carrera marble floor was heated throughout, rain shower was to die for! | Location, as it turned out, was as good as it can be. We were 5 minutes walk to Trafalgar Square, but it was very quiet. Right outside was Embankment tube stop. We would walk to theater area and to numerous restaurants, and many major sites, such as London Eye or Westminster Abbey were within walking distance. | We had buffet breakfast or room service every morning. It was pricy, but my rate included it. Couple of nights, we had glass of wine sitting in front of fire place in the lobby. I used the spa, which is included in the room rate, almost every night. After a windchill day of sightseeing, the steam sauna and jacuzzi would soften my weary muscles. | I have stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world, but this hotel tops it. I would return here in a heartbeat next time I am in London.",

So I heard about the corinthia via some friends who work in the industry and said their bar was really something. Until the incident I had stay there a total of 3 times but on the 4th time in June I was on my second of 4 nights and was about get some cash from my room as I was going to exchange money for some dollars as I was flying to the US pretty soon. When I came to my money it felt light. When I counted it, it was almost Â£1000 down. Obviously shocked I contacted reception. They started an investigation! | Well a couple of days later I had to checkout and the matter was not resolved. I was made to pay my bill in full. | Upon my return to London I met up with a manager at the hotel Jean Louis. He said the matter was still under investigation and he gave me his card to get in touch. Nothing was ever resolved. | This hotel does not only boast to be one of the best hotels in London but one of the best in the world. You pay premium for this reason and you expect a premium service. This hotel epically failed me and dented my confidence in the hotel industry. I didn't even get a formal apology. | It's a lovely hotel but I would have to say stay at your own risk but for over Â£500 a night should there be any risk?",

Mandarin Oriental is on of the best hotel groups, perhaps even the best, but their London property needs some TLC. I got great service, a nice upgrade (large room), but it was too used to feel like a real MO. Its like getting the old BA first class vs. the new; its good, but dated. And you know they can do better. The bar was nicer before the redid it some time ago, and its more drunk biz-pople than a mixed crowd there. Dinner by Heston was closed due to flew issues?? for a week, and Baloud in the basement is not very cozy or elegant. Comparing London to the still great NYC property, or the fantastic Bangkok property, its not worthy of the MO-brand. But its still a good hotel, make no mistake. Call in the designers and redo the reception, bar and first floor area with some seating, touch-up the rooms, and the impression will be so much better!",

The balcony overlooks St Pauls, and as most visitors to London will know, central London at night is a must see! | Before I proposed, we went for a few drinks in the Rumpus Room, which is the Mondrian's rooftop terrace bar which offers 360 degree views around London. The atmosphere of the bar is very chic and sophisticated, offering an excellent signature cocktail list. | Throughout the trip, the staff were all incredibly attentive and really did all they could to help me with the proposal and make sure that the whole experience was a magical one. | Really would recommend the hotel and we'll definitely be back.",

We stayed six nights and after the first night asked to change rooms. We were staying in a standard king room and all I can say is it was shabby without the chic. Furniture is worn out, rug unraveling, and really no light as there was only a small window. For the pleasure of $100 USD more per night, we got moved to a refurbished room (ask when you check in). | The hallways really smell like grandma's attic - no kidding. | The service was also very hit and miss (as it turns out). | -- We tried on two separate evenings to get a bottle of champagne put on ice before we returned to the hotel but both times we returned to the room with no ice bucket (and this was with several hours notice). To be fair, after whining about it (because I was not happy), two complimentary glasses of champagne did show up with a nice bowl of nuts. | -- Thinking it was an apology, a fruit plate also showed up (it was put in our room but not meant for us). Sorry Mr. Smith but you will not be getting your welcome fruit plate. | -- When we moved rooms they didn't bring the guard railing for the toddler bed. We called and called. When we got back to the room late, there was a guard rail but it was literally in about 20 pieces laying on the ground by the door with the box next to it. Where we suppose to put it together for them? | On the plus side, the housekeeping staff are really good. Your room looks great when you return. They adjust the number of towels you need based on how you use them. The sheets are also extremely soft. | I've read all the reviews of how fabulous the service is and how special they make you feel -- we just didn't get that. We have been fortunate to stay in some fabulous five-star hotels around the world and this experience just didn't stack up.",

Our bags were carried up and down for us and there are conveniences that the big hotels don't offer like free wi-fi or use of their computer, free direct dial telephone and a frig in the room. But certainly the best thing about the Rhodes is not a thing, it's Chris and Maria. Maria is a fount of useful helpful information about where to go and how to get there. She takes each guest under her wing and treats them as if they are the only one staying with them. She arranged for a car to take us to Heathrow that was cheaper than the tube.

    "review_text":"We stayed for a few days in October, and it was a perfectly adequate hotel for our needs (a few days of leisurely sightseeing/shopping/eating). The location is wonderful- right at the Hyde Park corner tube stop, and across the street from Hyde Park. We enjoyed morning walks/runs/coffee every morning of our stay. There are a few pubs/restaurants nearby, as well as the bar/restaurant of the hotels in that area, but it's more of a residential/embassy area. Our room was fine, although on the first floor and a mostly frosted glass window with not much light coming through. The marble bathroom with heated floor is a nice touch! Everything was clean. The reason I gave it 3 stars is actually the service. Most people were polite, but there was were a few distinctive &amp; unhelpful interactions during our stay. First, we arrived pretty early from an international, overnight flight. We were obviously kind of tired and hoping they might have a room available, although fully aware they may not. We arrived to the hotel around 8:30am, and a room was not offered to us until 2:15pm. We had a very overpriced breakfast in the hotel, went for a long walk, and came back around 11:30, at which point we needed to change for a lunch. They offered us the stairwell &amp; lobby bathrooms to change in...which was really not very useful, although we did it. The other main issue I had was that their service in terms of our room &amp; belongings was rather invasive. They sent a butler to show the \"room features\", and then at turn down on the first night, they did quite a bit of unnecessary &amp; unwelcome unpacking of our clothes. They put things in the closet that we had to search for when we returned, and even put some clothes (some of which were our pajamas!) into the hotel laundry bag. I don't know if most people use the laundry service, but we were there for only a few days and it was most annoying for them to presume (and select which clothes) that we would send out our laundry. These were minor incidents, but because the place prides itself on service, I found this incongruous. We also asked twice to use the hotel car, and it was not available either time. We got a fairly good deal, and with the comfortable bed, clean bath &amp; great location, I would have felt like it was a place I could recommend. The invasive nature of the daily cleaning &amp; turndown services however truly detracted from our experience.",

    "review_text":"Lovely furnishings, amenities and service. However, when returning to my suite early one afternoon, I discovered an unexpected visitor. Unbeknownst to the 'visitor', I had observed him entering my room from a distance. He appeared to be a maintenance person but later I realized he may have had more in mind than maintenance. | Some indicators: He did not place notification of his presence on the door so I would be aware of him before I entered; when I entered I called out and he did not reply or in any way acknowledge his presence (he may have thought I was housekeeping and would leave without discovering him in this fairly large 4 room suite); even as I entered the sitting room, he did not make himself known; once I observed him, he did not identify himself; his stance and location in the very center of the bedroom with no tools in hand was awkward; his explanation of repairing the ceiling chandelier which was - and had been - working perfectly was obviously fabricated on the spot; his sardonic remark as he quickly left was frightening. In hind sight I believe this person had malicious intentions. | All was reported to management. I requested a change of locking mechanisms but this request was declined. I was offered a fresh pot of tea. | After returning home, I had a brief email communication with the head of maintenance who assured me it was a maintenance employee who had entered to replace a light bulb. However he failed to explain why the man did not have a ladder with him as the light bulbs would not be visible without being able to see above the shades which were about 7 to 8 feet above the floor, much less be able to replace the bulbs. | I also sent an email to the regional office about two weeks ago and have yet to receive a reply. | Add to my experience the feeble fairy tale told by maintenance, the failure of a response from regional, and the casual attitude of the manager on site, it does appear there are security issues. Management does not want to discuss the problem, of course, because of negative publicity. | In hindsight I should have reported this to the police. I would advise not to stay at this hotel.",

    "review_text": "A weekend at The Savoy-what more could a mother ask for as a special birthday present? My biggest fear was that as we didn't fit into the usual demograph of Savoy customers we would feel uncomfortable-not so at all.Our son who is a frequent business traveler used his 'points' for our weekend -it gave him the opportunity to assess the hotel for his business too.We were welcomed personally and check in was smooth. Shown up to our adjoining rooms-first hiccup only one child bed but that was easily remedied-the children were each given a toy cat-nice touch.. The rooms are lovely- warm and spotless of course with loads of fluffy towels and interesting toiletries-the bathrooms were huge! There isn't time to list all the ways in which the concierge service helped us-they were amazing directing us to perfectly acceptable eating places nearby, booking tickets and generally making sure that we wanted for nothing. Also amazing was the service-I had to do a double take when I saw a man in a tail coat making the morning tea-he was the butler. A small birthday treat had been arranged but when it didn't materialise the apology included a bottle of champagne! I don't suppose I'll ever stay there again but what I would say is if you do get the chance to go don't be intimidated-go for it. Well done all at The Savoy-a reputation very well deserved-now where's that lottery ticket!",
